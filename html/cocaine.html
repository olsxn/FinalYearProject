              Cocaine, commonly known as coke, is a strong stimulant derived
              from the coca plant most frequently used as a recreational drug.
              It is normally snorted, inhaled as smoke, or dissolved and
              injected into a vein.
            </p>
            <p class="pLeftLarge">
              It is the second most popular recreational drug in the UK and is
              highly addictive due to its effect on the reward pathway in the
              brain. It acts by inhibiting the reuptake of certain
              neurotransmitters, resulting in a greater concentration of those
              neurotransmitters. This is what causes its effects.

              Typically, it can make users become chattier and more confident,
              but some people can become overconfident, arrogant, and angry. It
              can also increase a user’s sexual desires, and some people take it
              to have more intense sex.

            <p class="pLeftLarge">
              These effects and their intensity tend to last longer if the user
              takes more but can also depend on whether they have eaten or taken
              other drugs. However, if used on its own its mental effects laid
              out above last around 20 to 30 minutes. Users tend to experience
              the physical effects, such as a faster heartbeat, after the mental
              effects have gone.

              Some users find that using cocaine makes them feel down, anxious

              days after.

              The stimulant effects of the coca leaf have been known in Latin
              America for at least 1,000 years, but cocaine itself was not
              successfully created until 1855. After this, its psychoactive
              effects began to be explored, and the drug rapidly established
              itself across the Wester world as both a medicine and a
              recreational substance.
            </p>
            <p class="pLeftLarge">
              Its spread was helped by its inclusion in products such as Mariani
              wine and the original Coca-Cola recipe. By 1879, cocaine was being
              used as a treatment for morphine addiction, and a few years later
              was introduced as a local anaesthetic. Subsequently, cocaine was
              employed as a diet drug and as a stimulant for soldiers and
              explorers.
            </p>
            <p class="pLeftLarge">
              Abuse of cocaine was recognised as a vice by the late Victorian
              era. Over the course of the 20th century, it grew to prominence as
              a highly desirable recreational substance associated with high
              living.

            <p class="pLeftLarge">
              In modern times, cocaine use has reached pandemic levels, with
              between 14 and 21 million individuals using the drug each year
              worldwide, creating a market worth anywhere between 100 and 500
              billion dollars.

              Cocaine is one of the most addictive and damaging recreational
              drugs. Many thousands of people in the UK struggle with cocaine
              addiction at a huge cost to themselves and their loved ones.

            <p class="pLeftLarge">
              Addiction is fundamentally a disorder of the brain’s reward
              centres, repeated exposure over time to rewarding stimuli and
              behaviour will make the brain adjust to that excessive exposure.
              As these reward centres continue to adapt to repeated cocaine use,
              the user will become more and more reliant upon taking cocaine in
              order to experience pleasurable sensations associated with it.
            </p>
            <p class="pLeftLarge">
              Cocaine is not considered to be physically addictive. The
              dependence that can result because of cocaine use is primarily a
              psychological phenomenon, and the symptoms of withdrawal
              associated with cocaine abuse are consequently mainly
              psychological in nature.
