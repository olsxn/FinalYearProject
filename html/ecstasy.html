              Ecstasy is a popular club drug that is sold in pill and powder
              form. In its powder form, it is called MDMA but it is the same
              drug as ecstasy.
            </p>
            <p class="pLeftLarge">
              Pills can be white, coloured, round, square or pressed into any
              shape. Some pills have designs stamped into them, like well known
              company logos that the pills are then named after. Ecstasy powder
              looks like white/grey crystals and is called MDMA, mandy or MD.
            </p>
            <p class="pLeftLarge">
              Ecstasy pills are usually swallowed, although some people crush
              them up and snort them. The amount of MDMA in ecstasy pills varies
              massively. Some pills sold as ecstasy actually contain other, more
              dangerous, drugs that take longer to kick in. For this reason, you
              should never take a whole pill in one go, even if you’ve taken
              ecstasy before.
            </p>
            <p class="pLeftLarge">
              Drinking too much (including water) can also be dangerous. Users
              should sip no more than a pint of water or non-alcoholic drink
              every hour.
            </p>
            <p class="pLeftLarge">
              People usually take MDMA powder by dabbing it onto their gums or
              by swallowing it wrapped in a cigarette paper, which is sometimes
              called ‘bombing’. MDMA users often start by dabbing just a small
              amount of powder and waiting for the effects to kick in.
            </p>
            <p class="pLeftLarge">
              Like with pills, drinking too much (including water) can also be
              dangerous. Users should sip no more than a pint of water or
              non-alcoholic drink every hour.

              Using ecstasy makes most people feel:
            </p>
            <ul class="ulLeftLarge">
              <li>Very happy</li>
              <li>
                "Loved up" - users often feel love and affection for the people
                they're with and the strangers around them
              </li>
              <li>Energised and alert</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="pLeftLarge">
              Ecstasy can also make people feel more in tune with their
              surroundings and music can feel more intense, which is why people
              often take it in nightclubs or at parties.
            </p>
            <p class="pLeftLarge">
              Some users have reported feelings of:
            </p>
            <ul class="ulLeftLarge">
              <li>Anxiety</li>
              <li>Panic attacks</li>
              <li>Confused episodes</li>
              <li>Paranoia and even psychosis after talking ecstasy</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="pLeftLarge">
              Lots of people feel very chatty and uninhibited on ecstasy, which
              makes them open up and talk about things they might not do
              normally.
            </p>
            <p class="pLeftLarge">
              Physical side effects can include:
            </p>
            <ul class="ulLeftLarge">
              <li>Dilated pupils</li>
              <li>Tingling sensations</li>
              <li>Tightening or moving of the jaw muscles (gurning)</li>
              <li>Raised body temperature</li>
              <li>A faster heartbeat and nausea</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="pLeftLarge">
              How long the effects last and how long the drug stays in your
              system depends on how much you've taken, your size, whether you've
              eaten and what other drugs you may have also taken.
            </p>
            <p class="pLargeCenter"><strong>To kick in</strong></p>
            <p class="pLeftLarge">
              When taken orally, ecstasy normally takes 30 minutes to kick in,
              but it could take as little as 20 minutes, or it may take over an
              hour or more. Some other (more dangerous) drugs sold as ecstasy
              take longer to kick in.
            </p>
            <p class="pLargeCenter"><strong>How long it lasts</strong></p>
            <p class="pLeftLarge">
              Users tend to feel high for 2 to 4 hours. You might still
              experience some physical effects, like a fast heart beat or
              insomnia (not being able to sleep), for a few hours after you stop
              feeling high – especially if you take a lot.
            </p>
            <p class="pLargeCenter"><strong>After effects</strong></p>
            <p class="pLeftLarge">
              Some people find that ecstasy makes them feel down and low in mood
              the next day, known as a ‘comedown’. This can last for several
              days.
            </p>

              It's possible to build up tolerance to ecstasy, which means people
              need to take more of the drug to get the same buzz.
            </p>
            <p class="pLeftLarge">
              You may also develop a psychological dependence, which is a strong
              desire to keep on using even if you think your use is having
              harmful consequences.

            <p class="pLeftLarge">
              Spotting an ecstasy addiction can be hard because the withdrawal
              symptoms of the drug aren’t very obvious, and users comprise young
              people who abuse the drug in social settings. However,
              understanding the health, behavioural, and emotional signs of
              ecstasy addiction can help you find out the situation of your
              loved one.
            </p>
            <p class="pLeftLarge">
              While it’s hard to come to the realisation that you’re abusing and
              may have become addicted to the drug yourself, it’s important that
              you look around you to weigh the changes and damages that may have
              occurred in your life since you started using ecstasy. Finding out
              these signs can help you understand that you need help.

              <strong>Changes in social circle</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="pLeftLarge">
              Ecstasy is commonly abused in social circles and the drugs’
              effects bring these people together more often. If your loved one
              or teenager begin to abuse ecstasy, you’ll notice that they no
              longer keep company that discourages drug use.
            </p>
            <p class="pLeftLarge">
              There’ll be a shift to friends who love partying and experimenting
              with illicit drugs. What’s more, they may no longer show up at
              social events, like family get-togethers, as they used to. They’d
              rather spend more time in social gatherings where there’ll have
              access to the drug.
            </p>
            <p class="pLargeCenter">
              <strong>A preoccupation with ecstasy use</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="pLeftLarge">
              Ecstasy addicts are typically fixated on the rush the drug
              provides and are always looking forward to their next dose. This
              will be indicated by their unease around other people and their
              irritable behaviours when they have been without the drug for a
              while.
            </p>
            <p class="pLeftLarge">
              They will also forego certain responsibilities for the chance to
              get their hands on their next dose. This will be noticeable in
              their dealings with strange people who they never dealt with in
              the past and an eagerness to join groups and company that are into
              drug use.
            </p>
            <p class="pLargeCenter"><strong>Unusual level of energy</strong></p>
            <p class="pLeftLarge">
              The stimulant effects of ecstasy induce an abnormal level of
              energy in users. If you suspect a loved one of ecstasy abuse and
              addiction, you’ll notice that they’re unusually stimulated for
              long hours, actively friendly in an abnormal, unusual manner, will
              be awake for long hours, and could be dancing and having fun for a
              long time.
            </p>
            <p class="pLargeCenter"><strong>Problems in social life</strong></p>
            <p class="pLeftLarge">
              Ecstasy addicts go out of their way to get their hands on the drug
              and may be blinded by the risks involved in spending so much time
              and money on it. This results in the addict going through
              financial problems and suffering employment issues. The illegal
              status of the drug could also expose addicts to clashes with law
              enforcement, and jail for possession.
            </p>
            <p class="pLeftLarge">
              It’s also possible that they could lose their jobs after failing
              routine drugs tests because they’ll almost always be using. If
              your loved one is going through legal, employment, and financial
              problems, this could be an indication that they’re addicted to
              ecstasy.

              The number of young people entering treatment for problems with
              ecstasy in 2017/18 increased by 16% from the previous year (1,815
              to 2,112) and almost doubled from 2013/14. An increase in
              treatment for ecstasy was seen across all age groups.
            </p>
            <p class="pLeftLarge">
              In the same year, 14% of young people reported the drug as either
              a primary or adjunctive problematic substance.

              The trend in the proportion of 16 to 59 year olds using ecstasy in
              the 2018/19 has been relatively flat, fluctuating between one and
              two per cent (see chart below). The proportion of last year
              ecstasy users aged 16 to 59 in the 2018/19 survey (1.6%) was
              similar to the 2017/18 report (1.7%).
            </p>
            <p class="pLeftLarge">
              Among 16 to 24 year olds, the trend shows greater fluctuation
              between years. Following a generally downward trend from 1996,
              there was an increase in last year use among this age group
              between the 2011/12 (3.3%) and 2018/19 (4.7%) surveys. Whilst
              estimated levels of use have fluctuated between 4.3 and 5.4 per
              cent in recent years, prevalence of ecstasy use among 16-24 year
              olds remain below its peak of 6.8 per cent estimated from the
              2001/02 survey.
