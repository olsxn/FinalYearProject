              Cannabis, popularly known as marijuana or weed, is a psychoactive
              drug from the Cannabis plant and is used primarily for medical or
              recreational purposes. THC is the main psychoactive component of
              cannabis, one of the 483 known compounds in the plant. It can be
              used by smoking or vaporising it, within food or as an extract. It
              has mental and physical effects. It causes a high, or stoned
              feeling and other effects, including a general change in thought
              and perception, relaxation and an increase in appetite.

              Medical cannabis refers to the use of cannabis and its
              cannabinoids to treat or improve symptoms for a wide range of
              diseases and conditions. These include, but are not limited to:

              Cannabinoids, the active chemicals in cannabis, are similar to

              It’s best to think of medical cannabis like any other drug
              compound. Some of the benefits have pretty strong science behind
              them and others are anecdotal.

            <p class="pLeftLarge">
              Here in the UK, patients have been able to be prescribed medical
              cannabis by specialist doctors since the 1st of November 2018. The
              decision to prescribe medical cannabis must be made by a
              specialist doctor, not a GP. These doctors focus on one field of
              medicine such as neurology or paediatrics and are listed on the
              General Medical Council’s specialist register. (GOV.UK, 2018)
            </p>
            <p class="pLeftLarge">
              Decisions on prescribing cannabis-based products for medicinal use
              is on a strict case-by-case basis however, so it is extremely
              uncommon at this moment in time. Just this year, in January, a
              three year old girl was given a cannabis prescription to treat her
              severe epilepsy (Medical Cannabis Network, 2020).

              More commonly found in the UK are cannabidiol, commonly known as
              CBD, products. Cannabidiol is one of the 483 chemical compounds in
              the cannabis plant. CBD products are legal in the UK as long as
              they do not contain any detectable levels of controlled
              substances, such as THC.

              CBD has no psychoactive properties and will not give a high. There
              is no evidence it has any abuse or dependence potential and to

              side effects, according to the World Health Organisation.

              Cannabis is the most popular recreational drug in the UK outside
              of alcohol and tobacco, making it the most popular illegal drug.
              The immediate desired affects from consuming cannabis include
              relaxation, euphoria (the high), and a myriad of other potential
              affects.
            </p>
            <p class="pLeftLarge">Some side effects include:</p>

              Research shows that 10% of regular cannabis users become dependent
              on it. The risk is higher if a user starts using it in their
              teenage years or if they use it every day. As with other addictive
              drugs, you can develop a tolerance to it. This means you need more
              to get the same effect.
            </p>
            <p class="pLeftLarge">
              If you stop using it, you may get withdrawal symptoms such as:

              Users who smoke cannabis with tobacco could get addicted to
              nicotine and risk getting tobacco-related diseases, such as cancer
              and coronary heart disease.

              Regular cannabis use also increases your risk of developing a
              psychotic illness, such as schizophrenia. A psychotic illness is
              one where someone has hallucinations and delusions (believing
              things that are not true). It also increases the risk of a relapse
              in people who already have schizophrenia or other psychotic
              illnesses.

              In 2014, 93% of drug users in the UK, more than 14 million people,
              had used marijuana. This had been increasing every since 2008,
              when 87% had used it. It is often depicted as a gateway drug, and
              it is true that it is the drug that most drug users use first. It
              was the first drug that 82% of drug users used. There is no clear
              evidence, however, that the use of marijuana directly leads to the
              use of other drugs. In fact, half of marijuana users have never
              even taken another drug.

              In 2018, cannabis was once again the most commonly used drug, with
              6.6% of adults having used it in the last year. This was very
              similar to the two previous years but showed a significant fall

              In 2017-18, there were 10,666 individuals aged 18 to 24 who had
              started treatment for their problems. The majority of these
              individuals (5,791 or 54%) had problems with cannabis. Despite
              this, it only made up for 20% of the total reported problematic
              substance use, dwarfed by alcohol (49%) and opiate and crack
              cocaine use.

              These statistics show that cannabis is a small part of the much
              larger problem that is substance abuse and addiction in the UK. It
              would not be right to say that it leads users onto harder drugs
              and this is what most education on this drug tries to tell us.
              <br />
              The reality is that cannabis has its own distinct advantages and
              disadvantages and can affect each person vastly differently. It is
              down to each individual user to recognise the effect it is having
              on them and make their own decisions regarding the drug. The
              undeniable fact is that using cannabis recreationally every day
              has a clear effect on mental state and can cause many long-lasting
              problems for any individual.
