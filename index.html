              I believe is not currently available to them.

              The government advises schools when it comes to educating young
              people on drugs that the schools have a clear role to play in
              preventing drug misuse as part of their pastoral responsibilities.
              They make sure the school staff have the information, advice and
              power to:
              <ul class="ulLeftLarge">
                <li>Provide accurate information on drugs and alcohol through education and targeted information, including via the FRANK service</li>
                <li>
                Tackle problem behaviour in schools, with wider powers of search and confiscation
                </li>
                <li>
                  Work with local voluntary organisations, health partners, the police and others to prevent drug or alcohol misuse
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="pLeftLarge">
            Schools may also:
            </p>
            <ul class="ulLeftLarge">
                <li>Develop a drugs policy which sets out their role in relation to all drug matters</li>
                <li>Have a designated senior member of staff with responsibility for the drug policy and all drug issues within the school</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4 text-white text-center">
            <p class="pLeftLarge">
              I think there are a few fundamental problems with this approach, it places all of the 
              responsibilities of developing a drug policy, forming an education and gathering information on 
              one person. If this person is chosen without much thought it could lead to an unenthusiastic 
              approach to the policy which directly effects the quality of the education. 
            </p>
            <p class="pLeftLarge">
              This leads to approaches to educating children and young adults on drugs, and the effects they have 
              mentally and physically, that are insufficient, outdated and ineffective. 
              Common strategies such as “Just say no” and “shock/scare” do little to educate people and have been 
              pushed and designed by people who don’t understand the subject area.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4 text-white text-center">
            <p class="pLeftLarge">
              Better quality drug education and more engagement with young adults on the subject will result in a reduction of drug abuse and its associated mental and physical problems.
              Drug abuse is a broad problem, while there is certainly evidence that specific factors in an individuals life can increase or decrease their chances on engaging in illicit drug use (such as their family environment, affluence and the area they live in) no one is invulnerable to the possibility of becoming addicted to drugs.
              </p>
              <p class="pLeftLarge">
                With this website, I hope to fill a gap wherein somebody of the same age group and with personal ties to these problems is presenting valid and relevant information in a way that is not condescending to young adults. I strongly believe that this difference in the style of education will help the users to connect with and take in the information presented to them.

          On this website, I am going to explore the three most common recreationally used drugs in the UK: 
          <ul class="ulLeftLarge">
            <li>Marijuana</li>
            <li>Cocaine</li>

        <p class="pLeftLarge">
          For each drug, I will present the usage statistics, common misconceptions and important information plainly for young adults to read.
        </p>
        <p class="pLeftLarge">Each section will have a quiz at the end of it that will test the information presented in it. </p>

          <p class="pLeftLarge">My goal with these quizzes is to engage the user and encourage them to

          <p class="pLeftLarge">I hope that this approach will help the people who visit this website truly 
            understand the reality of the drug in question and the issues surrounding it and to deliver this information in a more casual way than other sources.</p>

          The National Drug Treatment Monitoring System (NDTMS) statistics
          report 2017/18 presents information on adults (aged 18 and over) who were
          receiving help in England for problems with drugs and alcohol
          during 2017-18. You will see this report, and most likely some of
          the same statistics, being used on all three of the substance pages.
          <br />This is because of the way it presents its more general
          statistics. It does, however, contain specific statistics on each
          drug too.
        </p>
        <p class="pLeftLarge">
          This report divides those adults into four clear groups:
        </p>
        <ul class="ulLeftLarge">
          <li>
            Opiate - people who are dependent on or have problems with
            opiates, mainly heroin
          </li>
          <li>
            Non-opiate - people who are dependent on or have problems with
            non-opiate drugs, such as cannabis, crack and ecstasy
          </li>
          <li>
            Non-opiate and alcohol - people who are dependent on or have
            problems with both non-opiate drugs and alcohol
          </li>
          <li>
            Alcohol only - people who are dependent on or have problems with
            alcohol but don’t have problems with any other substances
          </li>
